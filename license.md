## LICENSE file

Usually all projects start as private repoâ€™s. A private repository does not need a `LICENSE.md` file, it is always concidered proprietary.

If you work on a public repository, by convention it will follow the MIT license, and it should include a copy of this file in your repository: https://github.com/linkorb/skeleton/blob/master/LICENSE

The `composer.json` file should also refer to the MIT license using this snippet:

```
"license": "MIT"
```
