## File naming conventions

* Always follow PSR-0, 1, 2 and 4
* Always use 4 spaces for indention. Not tabs.
* All “controller” files should be in a directory called `Controller` (directly in `src/` or in a sub-directory where applicable). And be postfixed with `Controller`. For example: `Acme/ProjectName/Controller/DemoController`
* All “interface” files should be postfixed with `Interface`. For example: `Acme/ProjectName/DemoInterface`
* All “repository” files should be in a directory called `Repository` (directly in `src/` or in a sub-directory where applicable). And be postfixed with `Repository`. For example:
`Acme/ProjectName/Repository/PdoUserRepository`
